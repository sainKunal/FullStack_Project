Project overview 🔍
This repository provides a typical full-stack app layout intended as a starting point for building web applications. It contains conventions and examples for running locally, testing, linting, and deploying. Update the folder names, commands, and example environment variables to match your actual code if they differ.

Repository structure (example) 🗂️
- /backend or /server - backend API (Node/Express, Nest, etc.) 🧩
- /frontend or /client - frontend app (React, Vite, Next, etc.) 🖥️
- /scripts  automation scripts (optional) 🔁
- .env.example - example environment variables 🧾
- README.md - this file 📘

Tech stack (example) 🧰
- Backend: Node.js, Express (or another server framework) ⚙️
- Frontend: React (Create React App, Vite, Next.js, etc.) ✨
- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (choose the one you use) 🗄️
- Auth: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session-based auth 🔑
- Tooling: npm / yarn, ESLint, Prettier, Jest / Vitest 🛠️

Requirements ✅
- Node.js 14+ (or the version your project requires) 🟢
- npm (or yarn) 📦
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, recommended for local databases) 🐳
- A database (Postgres, MongoDB) depending on your chosen stack 🗄️

Getting started ▶️

1) Clone the repository 🧾
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sainKunal/FullStack_Project.git
cd FullStack_Project
```

2) Determine which folders hold the backend and frontend (examples below assume `backend/` and `frontend/`).

Backend (example) ⚙️
```bash
cd backend
# install deps
npm install
# create .env from .env.example and set variables
cp .env.example .env
# run in development
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

Frontend (example) 🎛️
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# create .env from frontend/.env.example if provided
cp .env.example .env
# start dev server
npm start
# or for Vite
npm run dev
```

Open the frontend in your browser (typically http://localhost:3000) and ensure backend is running on its configured port (e.g., 4000).

Environment variables 🔐
Create a `.env` file from the provided `.env.example` files in backend/frontend. Do not commit `.env` to the repository.

Example backend `.env`
```
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development
```

Example frontend `.env` (Create React App/Vite)
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
# or
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

Database & seeds 🗄️
- If using migrations (Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize, Knex), run migrations before starting:
```bash
# example
npx prisma migrate deploy
# or
npm run migrate
```
- To seed:
```bash
npm run seed
```
If you're using Docker Compose, you can include a service for the DB and run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Scripts (example package.json scripts) 🏷️
- start - start production server ▶️
- dev - start development server with hot-reload 🔁
- build - build for production (frontend) 🏗️
- test - run tests 🧪
- lint - run linter 🧹
- format - run Prettier 🎨

Testing 🧪
Run tests for backend and frontend separately (depending on where each test suite lives):

Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

Linting & formatting 🧹
If configured:
```bash
# lint project (run from repo root or appropriate folder)
npm run lint

# format
npm run format
```

Docker (optional) 🐳
Add a `Dockerfile` for backend and frontend plus a `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate the app and a database for local development. Example (abstract):
- docker-compose.yml: backend, frontend (optional), db
- Build and run:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Deployment 🚢
- Backend: Deploy to providers like Heroku, Render, AWS ECS, DigitalOcean Apps, or Docker-based hosts.
- Frontend: Deploy static build to Vercel, Netlify, or serve via CDN.
- Common workflow:
  - Build frontend: `npm run build` (in frontend)
  - Set environment variables in the target environment
  - Use CI to run tests, linting, and publish artifacts
